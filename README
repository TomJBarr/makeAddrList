makeAddrList
===============================================================================
This tool makes a list of all addresses that own the specified ERC20 token.
Optionally it will list only those addresses that are registered with Turms AMT.
Or it will simply list all addresses that are registered with Turms AMT.

 usage:
 ./makeAddrList.sh [options] <token name> <token address> <output_file>

  <token address>   is the address of the ERC20 token for which you want to get
                    a list of all token holders.
  <output file>     is the file that will get the list of token holder addresses

 options are:
 -h                 causes this message to be displayed. alternate form --help.
 -v                 causes us to be verbose. If this option is specified,
                    extra, explanitory messages might be displayed.
                    an alternate form for this option is --verbose.
 --only-turms       only display addresses that are registered with Turms AMT.
 --all-turms        display all addresses that are registered with Turms AMT.
                    this implies --only-turms. also no other parameters should
                    be specified, except output file.

eg:
 ./makeAddrList.sh OWN 0x1460a58096d80a50a2F1f956DDA497611Fa4f165 OWN_addr_list.txt
or
 ./makeAddrList.sh --all-turms all_turms_addr_list.txt
