makeAddrList
===========================================================================
usage: node makeAddrList contractAddr addrListFile
where:
  contractAddr is the address of the ERC20 token for which you want to get
  a list of all token holders.
  addrListFile is the file that will get the list of token holder addresses

this tool collects all transfer events from the specified contract. fyi, according to
the ERC20 interface, the signature of the transfer event is:
  event Transfer( address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value);
for each from and to address the contract is queried to see if that address is
currently an owner. all owners are added to a list. the list is then sorted, and
duplicates are removed.

look at makeAddrList.sh, which just invokes makeAddrList and sorts the addresses
and removes duplicates (using typical linux system tools).
